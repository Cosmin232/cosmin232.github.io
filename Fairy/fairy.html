                May you find the courage to face each challenge with the same calmness as the waves around this beautiful birthday fairy in the picture.<br />
                May each sunrise bring new insights and each sunset a moment of reflection.<br />
                <br />
                May each step you take be guided by the wisdom you've gained.<br />
                May each wave you face bring clarity.<br />
                May each still moment bring peace.<br />
                May each challenge you encounter be met with the strength that lies within you.<br />
                And may your path forward reflect the same quiet dignity as the image before you.<br />
                <br />
                With consideration and love,<br />
                <br />
                Your brother,<br />
